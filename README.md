## Cheat sheet

* C-w Cut (kill)
* M-w Copy
* C-y Paste
* M-y cycle through killing ring, use it after C-y
* C-M-f Forward-sexp move to the closing parenthesis
* C-M-b Backford-sexp move to the open parenthesis
* C-h w {Command_name} to see the key binding of the given command
* C-t swap two letters
* C-x C-t to swap two lines, swap the bottom line with the line above
* C-M-up-arrow/down-arrow move a line up and down, similar to vscode like editor, I think this is space macs specific thing, but it's good.
